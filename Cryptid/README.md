# Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore some Encryption and Decyption basics, and build the foundation of a scalable cybersecurity library. This was also built to practice writing scalable code architecture, including comprehensive Unit Testing suites and interface design.

This software uses the following features of C#:
- Classes
- Interfaces and Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- XUnit
- Reading/writing to/from a file

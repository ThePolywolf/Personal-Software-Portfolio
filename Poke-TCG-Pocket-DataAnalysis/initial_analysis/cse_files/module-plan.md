### Software Description 
I plan to create an analysis of the cards available in the *Pokemon TCG Pocket* mobile game, exploring the data to try and find any intersting patterns. This analysis will include card type analysis, damage capacity analysis, general card statistics, and one-on-one battle statistics. This project will include a simulation portion to simulate and generate battle data for further analysis in this study.

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
One risk of the personal project is the scope of the battle system, since I could easily see myself feeling overconfident and trying to expand it into something more complex.

##### Action Plan
I plan to keep the battle system very simple, and simulate one-on-one card battles, no matter what happens or how easy I feel it will be to expand.

#### Risk 2
Another risk is that the data from the battle simulations will be useless, or have little to no patterns

##### Action Plan
I plan to include hypothesis for what I think the data should show so that way, even if the data has little pattern to it, I can compare it to what I expected and use the analysis to show why what I expected did not happen.

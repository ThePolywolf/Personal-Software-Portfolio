# Overview

This project is based on the pre-existing dataset of cards from the Pokemon TCG Pocket mobile game, and simulating battles between pokemon using the set of Pokemon available in the game as of Feb, 2025. This project mimics the battle format experienced in the mobile game, and is built to be expandable for large-scale simulation to collect data on the performance of different cards.

The purpose of this project was to work on scalable simulation using a data-driven approach with a clear seperation of data access and manipulation throught he struct-module design pattern. This approach makes this software more scaleable as it is easy to add additional data access and manipulation to expand the feature set.

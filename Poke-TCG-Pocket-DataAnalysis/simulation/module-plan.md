### Software Description 
I plan to build on my previous module plan, and build the simulation for the *Pokemon TCG Pocket* dataset I was working with previously. The simulation will support most game features from the card game, and the successful result of this module will be a data analysis of the simulation results caused by pitting two different Pokemon against each other in a 2v2 battle (2 copies of each).

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

|**Friday**   | Modules - 2h, team: level design - 1h | Sim analysis - 1h |
|**Saturday** | Modules - 2h | Sim analysis - 1h, team: integrate player to attack system - 2h |


### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
One risk is that the scope of this project will exceed two modules; this is already an extension of the 2nd module plan, however I am worried the system will be even more involved than I am able to complete within this module.

##### Action Plan
If I do not fully complete the sims by the end of this module, I will wrap up my work into a stable enough state to submit for this module, but I will extend this project into one more module, and not allow myself any more extensions past that.

#### Risk 2
Risk 2 is that there is some small error in my simulation system, causing hours of sims to be run, but the generated data will be garbage.

##### Action Plan
I will run a small scale simulation (specifically targerting potential problem-causing pokemon in the sim) to test the results before applying the entire simulation.

### Software Description 
I will be building a simulation in Unity3D to procedurally generate a body mesh that will render in real-time, and interact with basic physics collisions.

### Module
Mark an **X** next to the module you are planning

### Create a Schedule
Create a detailed schedule using the table below to complete your selected module during this Sprint.  Include details such as what (task), when (time), where (location), and duration.  You should also include time to work on your team project.  You are expected to spend 16 hours every Sprint working on your individual module, team project, and other activities. Time spent on this individual module should be at least 10 hours.

### Identify Risks
Identify at least two risks that you feel will make it difficult to succeed in this module.  Identify an action plan to overcome each of these risks.

#### Risk 1
Time crunch. I have 2 days to build and complete this module. 

##### Action Plan
I will keep the scope of this project small while still meeting the minimum requirements. If I miss my 2 day deadline, there is nothing more that can be done.

#### Risk 2
Unity crashing due to massive physics load.

##### Action Plan
I will make sure I add safety checks into my model code to prevent too much load on the engine.
